## Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks

By ensuring that the setup-pre-commit.sh script has executable permissions and following these instructions, developers can easily set up and enforce pre-commit hooks in the repository, improving code quality and catching issues before they are committed.

To set up pre-commit hooks, follow these steps:
1.	Clone or initialize the new repository on your local machine.
2.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the repository. You can use the cd command to change directories:
##### cd /path/to/repository
3.  Ensure that the setup-pre-commit.sh script has executable permissions. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:
##### chmod +x setup-pre-commit.sh
4.  Run the ./setup-pre-commit.sh script in the terminal. This script automatically installs the pre-commit framework and sets up the hooks defined in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file:
##### ./setup-pre-commit.sh
5.  Once the pre-commit framework is installed and configured, the specified hooks will be enforced automatically whenever you make a commit.
This helps catch issues early in your local development environment, such as linting errors, formatting inconsistencies, missing documentation, and policy/security violations.
