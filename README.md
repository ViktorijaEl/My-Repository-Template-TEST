To set up pre-commit hooks, follow these simplified steps:

1. Clone or initialize the new repository on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
3. Run the `./setup-pre-commit.sh` script in the terminal.
   This script automatically installs the pre-commit framework and sets up the hooks defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
4. Once the pre-commit framework is installed and configured, the specified hooks will be enforced automatically whenever you make a commit.
   This helps catch issues early in your local development environment, such as linting errors, formatting inconsistencies, missing documentation, and policy/security violations.

By following these steps, developers can easily set up pre-commit hooks by running the `./setup-pre-commit.sh` script after cloning or initializing the repository. This ensures that the pre-commit framework is installed, the hooks are configured based on the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, and the hooks are enforced when making commits.
