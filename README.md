# My-Repository-Template-TEST

To set up pre-commit hooks, follow these simplified steps:
1.	Clone or initialize the new repository on your local machine.
2.	Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
3.	Ensure that the setup-pre-commit.sh script has executable permissions. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:
bashCopy code
chmod +x setup-pre-commit.sh 
4.	Run the ./setup-pre-commit.sh script in the terminal. This script automatically installs the pre-commit framework and sets up the hooks defined in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file.
5.	Once the pre-commit framework is installed and configured, the specified hooks will be enforced automatically whenever you make a commit. This helps catch issues early in your local development environment, such as linting errors, formatting inconsistencies, missing documentation, and policy/security violations.

By ensuring that the setup-pre-commit.sh script has executable permissions and following the updated instructions, developers can easily set up pre-commit hooks in the repository.
